# Wythoff's Game (Last Biscuit)

A Java implementation of **Wythoffâ€™s Game**, also known as the **Last Biscuit Game**.  
This was my **first-year university coursework** and my introduction to programming in Java.
Basic programming skills are used as this is when I started learning java so no OOP demonstrated here.

## ðŸŽ® Game Rules
- Two barrels start with **6** and **8** biscuits.  
- On their turn, a player can:
  - Take biscuits from **one barrel**,
  - Take the same number of biscuits from **both barrels**, or
  - **Skip a turn** (allowed only once per player).  
- The player who takes the **last biscuit wins**.

## ðŸ›  Features
- Constants for easier code maintenance.  
- Input validation for integers and legal moves.  
- Turn-based gameplay with clear prompts.  
- Tracks skip usage for each player.

## ðŸ“š What I Learned 
- Basic Java Syntax and program stucture.
- Using constants and string formatting for maintenance.
- Basic error handling and validating errors.
- Implementing a turn-based game loop.

## âœ¨ Future Improvements
- Add a computer player with simple AI.
- Allow variable starting biscuit counts.
- Improve user interface for clarity.
- Use OOP.
- Create exceptions for errors.
